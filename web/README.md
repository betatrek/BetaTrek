# Website directory

This is everything related to the front-end, everything required for showing the website. The content files exist in the ui directory itself, essentially the webpages. The WEB-INF directory contains mostly XML files used to define different aspects useful for setting up the servlet, the home page, URL rewriting, in general the settings for the website.
